A calculator application made using ReactJS following an [Everything React](https://blog.usejournal.com/everything-react-first-app-188b33a880ca) tutorial.

Tutorial was followed for layout, but calculations were modified to follow the Reverse Polish notation.

## To-Do
* Pop operands off of array after calculating result.
* Allow backspace to properly edit previous operand.
